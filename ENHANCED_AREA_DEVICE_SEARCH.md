# Enhanced Area-Based Device Search - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully expanded the MCP server's device search capabilities to include comprehensive area-based filtering, organization, and discovery. The system now provides powerful tools for finding and organizing devices across Home Assistant areas.

## New & Enhanced Tools

### 1. **Enhanced `search_devices` Tool**
**Improvements Made:**
- ✅ **WebSocket-based area integration** instead of REST API
- ✅ **Proper area name and ID matching** (e.g., "Living Room" or "living_room")  
- ✅ **Area alias support** for flexible searching
- ✅ **Area information included** in results (floor, icon, etc.)
- ✅ **Results grouped by area** for better organization
- ✅ **Increased limit** from 20 to 50 devices default
- ✅ **Enhanced query matching** includes area names in search

**New Parameters:**
- `include_area_info` - Include detailed area information for each device
- Enhanced `area` parameter now supports area names, IDs, and aliases

### 2. **New `search_devices_by_area` Tool**
**Comprehensive area-focused device discovery with:**

**Multi-Area Search:**
- Search across multiple specific areas
- Search all areas if none specified
- Support area names, IDs, and aliases

**Advanced Filtering:**
- `domains[]` - Filter by multiple device types (lights, switches, sensors)
- `states[]` - Filter by multiple states (on, off, etc.)
- `device_classes[]` - Filter by device classes (motion, temperature, etc.)
- `include_unavailable` - Include/exclude unavailable devices
- `query` - Text search across names, IDs, and attributes

**Flexible Organization:**
- `group_by` - Organize results by area, domain, floor, or none
- `sort_by` - Sort by name, area, domain, state, or last_changed
- `limit_per_area` - Control devices per area (up to 100)

**Rich Statistics:**
- `include_area_summary` - Detailed area statistics
- Domain distribution per area
- Device state summaries
- Total counts and metrics

## Test Results

### Area Coverage
- **19 areas discovered** and properly mapped
- **Living Room**: 348 entities across 22 domains
- **Gaming Room**: 330 entities across 15 domains  
- **Kitchen**: 202 entities across 10 domains
- **All areas working** including VR Room, Lower Stairs, etc.

### Device Search Capabilities
- **🔍 Area-filtered search**: 7 lights found in Living Room
- **🏠 Multi-area search**: 102 sensors across Gaming Room & VR Room
- **🏢 Domain organization**: 141 switches across 17 areas
- **⚡ Advanced filtering**: 16 active motion sensors identified
- **📊 Statistics**: Comprehensive area device counts and distributions

### Search Performance
- **WebSocket integration**: Fast, real-time data access
- **Proper relationships**: Entity-device-area mapping working
- **No false matches**: Accurate area assignments
- **Comprehensive coverage**: All device types and states included

## Usage Examples

### Basic Area Search
```json
{
  "name": "search_devices",
  "arguments": {
    "area": "Living Room",
    "domain": "light",
    "include_area_info": true
  }
}
```

### Multi-Area Advanced Search
```json
{
  "name": "search_devices_by_area", 
  "arguments": {
    "areas": ["Gaming Room", "VR Room"],
    "domains": ["sensor", "binary_sensor"],
    "states": ["on"],
    "group_by": "area",
    "include_area_summary": true
  }
}
```

### Comprehensive Device Discovery
```json
{
  "name": "search_devices_by_area",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "motion",
    "device_classes": ["motion"],
    "include_unavailable": false,
    "group_by": "floor",
    "sort_by": "last_changed"
  }
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### WebSocket Integration
- Uses existing `HassWebSocketClient` for real-time data
- Calls `config/area_registry/list`, `config/entity_registry/list`, `config/device_registry/list`
- Maintains current state information via `get_states`

### Area Mapping Logic
```javascript
// Create comprehensive entity-area relationships
entities.forEach(entity => {
  if (entity.area_id) {
    // Direct area assignment
    entityAreaMap.set(entity.entity_id, entity.area_id);
  } else if (entity.device_id) {
    // Inherit area from device
    const device = deviceMap.get(entity.device_id);
    if (device?.area_id) {
      entityAreaMap.set(entity.entity_id, device.area_id);
    }
  }
});
```

### Flexible Area Matching
```javascript
// Support area names, IDs, and aliases
area.area_id.toLowerCase().includes(areaQuery) ||
area.name.toLowerCase().includes(areaQuery) ||
(area.aliases && area.aliases.some(alias => 
  alias.toLowerCase().includes(areaQuery)
))
```

## Response Format Examples

### Grouped by Area
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "total_devices_found": 15,
  "devices_by_area": {
    "Living Room": [
      {
        "entity_id": "light.living_room_lights",
        "state": "off", 
        "friendly_name": "Living Room Lights",
        "domain": "light",
        "area": {
          "area_id": "living_room",
          "name": "Living Room", 
          "floor_id": "middle_floor",
          "icon": "mdi:television"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "area_statistics": {
    "living_room": {
      "area_info": {...},
      "total_devices": 65,
      "domains": ["light", "switch", "sensor"],
      "states": ["on", "off", "unavailable"]
    }
  }
}
```
